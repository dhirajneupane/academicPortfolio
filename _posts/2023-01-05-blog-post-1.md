 I had written this poem in 2013, about nine years ago. The poem talks about the life of an average Nepali citizen and compares that with the developed countries citizens. Thanks to Ambika Gautam for providing me with an opportunity to post the video on her youtube channel. The video was shot two years ago by Mr Yugesh K C. Huge thanks to my friend Yugesh.
