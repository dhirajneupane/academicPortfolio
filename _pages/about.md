Greetings, and welcome to my portfolio!

I am [Dhiraj Neupane](https://g.co/kgs/DLknVq){:target="_blank"}. You can call me Dhiraj, 디라지 or DJ whichever you find easier. I am a PhD student in [MLDS lab](https://deakin-mlds.github.io/index.html){:target="_blank"}, [Deakin University](https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/people/dhiraj-neupane){:target="_blank"}. I hail from Nepal and have had the privilege of studying in South Korea, where I earned my Master's degree in Information and Communication Engineering at [Changwon National University](https://www.changwon.ac.kr/eng/main.do){:target="_blank"}. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Kathmandu University](https://ku.edu.np/){:target="_blank"}. 

Throughout my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to work on exciting research projects that have expanded my knowledge in areas such as machine learning, deep learning, intelligent fault detection, sonar signal processing, computer vision, object detection, and classification. My research has led to publications in high-tier journals, which you can explore in the [Publication section](https://www.dhirajneupane.com.np/publications/){:target="_blank"} or on my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KtSkA68AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.

I worked as a Researcher at [IPCamp, South Korea](http://www.ipcamp.co.kr){:target="_blank"} from September 1, 2021 to August 31, 2022. Before this, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Changwon National Unversity](https://www.changwon.ac.kr/eng/cm/cntnts/cntntsView.do?mi=11228&cntntsId=4240){:target="_blank"}. I also worked as an Operation Assistant at [Nepal Electronic Payment Systems Ltd., Nepal](https://neps.com.np/){:target="_blank"}.

But academic pursuits are just one aspect of my life. Outside of my studies, I've been actively involved in various clubs and organizations. I served as the President of [Society of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Kathamndu University (SEEE- KU)](http://seee.ku.edu.np/board-members-2015-16/){:target="_blank"}, for the year 2015-16. I  also worked as the Joint Secretary and Executive member of [Amnesty International Kathmandu University Youth Network (AIKUYN)](https://www.facebook.com/aikuyn/){:target="_blank"} for the year 2014-15 and 2013-14 respectively.

I believe that success is not just about individual accomplishments but also about contributing to society. I am grateful for the opportunities I've had to serve and make a positive impact in the community.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.
