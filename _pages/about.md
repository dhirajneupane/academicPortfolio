Hello, नमस्ते, 안녕하세요. I am [Dhiraj Neupane](https://g.co/kgs/DLknVq). You can call me Dhiraj, 디라지 or Dj whichever you find easier. 

I am working as a PhD student in [MLDS lab](https://deakin-mlds.github.io/index.html), [Deakin University](https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/people/dhiraj-neupane). I received my Master's degree in Information and Communication Engineering from [Changwon National University, South Korea](https://www.changwon.ac.kr/eng/main.do){:target="_blank"}, in 2021, and my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Kathmandu University, Nepal](https://ku.edu.np/){:target="_blank"}, in 2016. I worked as a Researcher at [IPCamp, South Korea](http://www.ipcamp.co.kr){:target="_blank"} from September 1, 2021 to August 31, 2022. Before this, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Changwon National Unversity](https://www.changwon.ac.kr/eng/cm/cntnts/cntntsView.do?mi=11228&cntntsId=4240){:target="_blank"}. I also worked as an Operation Assistant at [Nepal Electronic Payment Systems Ltd., Nepal](https://neps.com.np/){:target="_blank"}.

Apart from academics, I was also envolved in various clubs and organizations. I served as the President of [Society of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Kathamndu University (SEEE- KU)](http://seee.ku.edu.np/board-members-2015-16/){:target="_blank"}, for the year 2015-16. I  also worked as the Joint Secretary and Executive member of [Amnesty International Kathmandu University Youth Network (AIKUYN)](https://www.facebook.com/aikuyn/){:target="_blank"} for the year 2014-15 and 2013-14 respectively.

My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, intelligent fault detection, sonar signal processing, computer vision, object detection, and classification. I have published few articles in high-tier journals. You can check them at [Publication](https://www.dhirajneupane.com.np/publications/){:target="_blank"} section or at my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KtSkA68AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.
