Hello, नमस्ते, 안녕하세요. I am Dhiraj Neupane, a deep learning researcher. I received my Master's degree in Information and Communication Engineering from [Changwon National University, South Korea](https://www.changwon.ac.kr/eng/main.do){:target="_blank"}, in 2021, and my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Kathmandu University, Nepal](https://ku.edu.np/){:target="_blank"}, in 2016. I am currently working as a Researcher at [IPCamp, South Korea](http://www.ipcamp.co.kr){:target="_blank"}. Before this, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Changwon National Unversity](https://www.changwon.ac.kr/eng/cm/cntnts/cntntsView.do?mi=11228&cntntsId=4240){:target="_blank"}. I also worked as an Operation Assistant at [Nepal Electronic Payment Systems Ltd., Nepal](https://neps.com.np/){:target="_blank"}.
